# NP complete problem solutions in the SameGame
The idea is based on:  
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.294.6089&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=63  
//TODO write a better reference


# SameGame rules I used:
-You gain n^2 point where n is the number of same colored tiles adjancented to each other.  
-There is no step limit.  
-There is no time limit.  
-The game field/board collapses downwards and leftwards if possible (there is enough empty space)  
-Tile without no same colored tiles adjancented is clickable and worth point. (planning to remove it later)
